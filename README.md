# Simple bidder service 

This is a simple Springboot service application that accepts AdRequests and responds with AdResponses. 

This is only for end to end tests and the responses can be configurable, according to the needs of the caller.

To run the service, download the code, build with maven (mvn clean package) and run the jar file with java. In the properties file change the port of the server (default port is 9090)
